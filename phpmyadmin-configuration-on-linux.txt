#Can not access to mysql

    In terminal login to MySQL as root. You may have created a root 
password when you installed MySQL for the first time or the password could be blank, if you have forgetten your root password could be blank, if you have 
forgotten your root password, you can reset the MySQL root password.

$ sudo mysql -p -u root

    Now add a new MySQL user with the username for your choice. In this example
we are calling it 'yourusername' and password 'password_here' make sure to replace 'yourusername' and 'password_here' with your own.


    The command bellow will create a new user called 'yourusername'(call this what you like ) which can access the MySQL server from localhost with the Password 'password_here'.

mysql> CREATE USER 'yourusername'@'localhost IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'password_here';


    Now we will grant superuser privilege to our new user 'yourusername'.

mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'yourusername'@'localhost' ;
